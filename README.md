# Show Local Weather

The purpose of this project is to show the local weather.

As a user, I expect to show the weather in my current location.

As a user, I expect to see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain) depending on the weather. 

As a user, I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
